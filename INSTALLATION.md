## Easy Start: Running with Docker Compose

Deploying the entire high-performance AI gateway infrastructure is now completely automated and takes just seconds. 

We provide pre-built, highly-optimized Docker images hosted on the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). All native hardware-acceleration drivers (CUDA, Vulkan, CPU backends) are **already baked into these images**, meaning zero compilation time and no massive downloads during setup.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local environment and navigate into the root directory:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Instancium/instant-ai-gate.git](https://github.com/Instancium/instant-ai-gate.git)
cd instant-ai-gate
```

### 2. Launch the Infrastructure
Start the gateway in detached mode using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
> 💡 **What happens under the hood:**
> Docker will instantly pull the pre-compiled native Linux-x64 computing cores from GHCR. It will completely bypass any compilation steps and automatically route your active hardware devices (including NVIDIA GPUs) directly to the inference core for maximum performance.

### 3. Access the Gateway Applications
Once the containers report an active operational status, you can immediately access the local deployment endpoints:

- **Management UI Console:** [http://127.0.0.1:49153/](http://127.0.0.1:49153/)
- **Core Processing Inference API:** [http://127.0.0.1:49152/](http://127.0.0.1:49152/)



> 🔄 **Updating to the latest version**
> Because everything is pre-built, keeping your gateway up to date is trivial. To fetch the newest features and performance improvements without losing your downloaded models, simply run:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
